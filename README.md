# Idea for the project
The idea is to develop a code able to reproduce a **diffraction pattern of a surface unit cell**. 
In order to do so, the user needs to specify the surface unit cell (and the type of atoms), thus the program will check for symmetries and extintion conditions and it will plot the difraction diagram. 
Additionally: evaluation of the diffracted intensity.
